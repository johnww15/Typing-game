# Developing a Typing Test Application

## Project Overview

Created a simple typing test application which randomly generates words from an existing fixed data file. Users will then attempt to type the correct words into the text area as fast as they can. When complete, the applications calculate the number of correct words types per minute. The user is also given the option to choose their level of difficulty when attempting the game.

## Technologies & Tools used

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- ReactJS
- Vite
- Git, Github

## Main Learning Objectives

- Utilising useContext for larger states
- Figuring out how to cross check user's input with rendered text in real time

## Summary

This is a front end project which I attempted in my free time to figure out how the text area inputs could be checked with the rendered game text and rendered in real time. Along the way, I was able to learn and use new functions and hooks from the React Library. It provided a good form of practice and challenge for me to attempt something new and interesting.
